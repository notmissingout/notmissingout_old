<div class="heading">The name of our site</div>

<div class="contenttextacross"><p>'Not missing out' seemed an apt name on several fronts. On hearing we were intending to home educate a relative said, "Oh but he'll miss out on so much not going to school". I found this a strange thought because I have yet to think of a single valuable experience he's missing. On the other hand I can think of many amazing experiences he has had by virture of belonging to our home education community that he probably wouldn't have had in school. He mixes with a much wider range of ages and people from different backgrounds and countries, he's taken part in fantastic workshops and discounted trips to places of interest, contributed to a community magazine, spent lots of time playing outdoors in nature, and learnt through play in a way that is virtually outlawed in the mainstream school system. Our style of home education also gives our son learning autonmy, putting him in charge of his own educational journey and allowing us to follow his interests. This is something only a handfull of school children (attending special democratic schools) ever experience.</p>

<p>Those who worry that children not attending school are missing out on something usually have a skewed view of home education. They imagine children sat alone at a kitchen table with worksheets, missing out on social interaction, school trips, sports days, school plays etc. The reality of home ed for most families is quite different. It is more social than school (where children may be in close proximity to each other but time for play and chatting are limited). There is a near constant supply of opportunities for organised trips and workshops, and there are home ed sports days, nativity plays, camping trips, Easter egg hunts, Christmas and Halloween parties - anything the children might take part in at school can be arranged for those interested.</p>

<p>The choice of name is also a nod to one of the less anticipated "problems" with home education - a fear of missing out. It's not a fear of missing out on things that might be happening in a classroom (those who want that sort of learning can create "school" at home), but missing out on the fabulous things available for home educated children. There is such an active, thriving community that there will often be multiple activities or trips that clash, and weeks can become so cramed full that we exhaust ourselves. Getting the balance right has probably been the hardest part of home ed so far.</p>

<p>As parents we are also "not missing out". Of course our choice means we miss out financially, but we've gained so much more. Our local home ed community is exactly that, a real community. We are priviledged to be part of something that provides support, comfort, friendship, and inspiration. With so much creative energy and so many unschoolers in the group, it encourages us as parents to continue our own learning and explore and develop our own creative outlets. I've always been a believer in life long learning and the idea that children learn by modelling the behaviour they see. Our style of home education allows me to learn alongside my son. Our lifestyle also gives our family more flexibility than most. Without the need to attend school we can travel and explore at off peak times, when places are quieter and costs reduced.</p>

<p>Home education isn't the answer for everyone but for us, well, we're really glad we're not missing out.</p>
